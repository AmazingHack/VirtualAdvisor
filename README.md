Virtual Advisor (VA)
A coequal UMSL DARS degree audit system.  A virtual automated university advisor.  VA takes into account the current DARS system and correlates the information on the audit and compares it to the universities predefined tagged computer science degree course requirements, inputted by the client.  The VA system, will look at completed course work, compare them to the computer science tagged required courses for degree completion, and provide a customized course catalogue for the end-user, student.  VA takes into account prerequisites, student level of education (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, graduate) and any degree, minor or certificate that the student may almost qualify for, and suggest courses and/or certifications that is feasible with minimal effort.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Give examples
Installing
This is a service that will be integrated into the client’s system by VA LLC.
 Say what the step will be
Once the client has hired VA LLC, the company will provide this service to the client.
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
Running the tests
Current demo can be implemented using a development Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  The IDE of choice is Inteli J.  Once the source code is uploaded into the IDE, then a test can be run.
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
Break down into end to end tests
VA runs a computer science major student’s degree audit, and suggests a semester -by- semester course plan of action for the end-user.  The current DARS system is very complicated and hard to understand, doesn’t give suggestions on getting the student an optimal course work plan of action to get the best results for desired niche within the computer science degree, it doesn’t keep track of courses taken and suggest minors, certifications or double majors to the end-user that they may have already almost accomplished, takes the confusion and stress out of planning a strong plan of action for the end-users, clarifies for the clients administration what students are planning to take in future years/terms so that they may prepare professors, scheduling rooms that fit the amount of students desiring to take the course in future (requires a room capacity database) and eventually give the end-user the option to take the course at night or day.

Deployment
Depends on client needs and/or requirements.  VA integrates to the client’s current degree audit system.
